title: "The Job Hunt vs Agency Experiment: A Tale of Two Paths"

This will be a big series, here is the first of a multi-parter. My thesis is that due to our current economic uncertainty and phenomena like [ghost jobs](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/ghost-jobs-why-fake-job-listings-are-on-the-rise.html) I think my future would be best spent diversifying into consulting and launching projects that supplement my income outside of work. I already have experience doing this in other [lines of business](https://collective.faith) and contracting in the past. In fact, I've been grinding out ideas since a wee lad. Perhaps another post will involve my history regarding ventures and an attempt at backtracking my knowledge garden. For now take it at face value that I have the requisite skillset.

I want to run an experiment to see what will come faster: a job, or an agency client. Take [y0uragency](https://y0ur.agency/), my first attempt at a brand in the space. An additional "constraint" is that I have to completely exhaust both methods. For job hunting, I have to be diligent about any opportunities that I can find, meaning outreach to hiring managers and HR professionals in companies. For the agency route, I'll exhaust ways of building a client pipeline. Let's look at a breakdown of each below to see what resources are available.

## Job
- Friends & Family
  - Will redact these for now but for the most part there aren't many in their industries that I would ideally want to work for
- Companies in industries of interest
  - Start with:
    - Crypto/Blockchain
    - Finance (Buy Side)
    - Sports/Gaming
    - Fashion
    - Technology
    - Higher Education
- Companies in localities of interest
  - Various global cities
- Hacker news
- Twitter (Hiring in title)
  - Can get creative in how to find them with advanced searching
- Remote Job boards and sites
- Agencies
- Craigslist
- LinkedIn - Post search
- Niche Language
- In person network
- [redacted] Slack

## Agency
- Create a twitter/personal dev twitter to live tweet this
- Make case studies and blog them
- Make blog in general
- Active on twitter
- Active on Reddit
- Exhaust paid list
  - Elaborate on this
- Outreach to owners of other agencies
- Blog about the micro agency book you read
- Government agencies
- Email outreach

Some other rules are that I'll only apply through career page websites and not LinkedIn. Need to keep track of all outreach, systemize this and evaluate the hypothesis. For now, I'll use Google Sheets as a public repository for my outreach tracking. The first route on the job side will be standard approach- applying to places that I'd like to work for, and doing targeted outreach to decision makers at these companies. On the agency side, I will start with @acharbohno's Devlist, and any auxiliary contacts on Upwork. Also, I have [consulted with a friend](https://x.com/_JesseRosa) for cold email outreach. Unfortunately, that Linkedin premium and Upwork proposal tax will kick my ass until I find something stable whether contract or full time.

## Why do this?

The cat is out of the bag in regard to remote work being higher leverage for the worker. I would go as far to argue that a lot of financialization is dependent on Real Estate as a linchpin, particularly commercial and its outlying economic effects. Not to mention currency debasement and the like. I'd rather give max effort for max leverage, giving freedom for optimization. That's probably the most cliche tenet of the entrepreneurial dream package (tm) but from a numbers perspective it's the only thing that makes sense to me. Perhaps a side effect of growing up on the Tim Ferris pod but nonetheless this is the course upon which to set sail. Follow the tweeter for the journey in real time [@_r_c_i_](https://x.com/_r_c_i_).
